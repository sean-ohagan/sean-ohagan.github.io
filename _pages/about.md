I'm a senior undergraduate student at the University of Connecticut studying mathematics and statistics.

I am broadly interested in probability, mathematical statistics, Bayesian statistics, and anything numerical, computational, or probabilistic.

Check out my [Visual Blog](/blog/) to see some nice expository visualizations that I'm currently working on.

In my free time, I enjoy spending time with friends, exercise, snowboarding, and puzzles (like the Rubik's cube).
