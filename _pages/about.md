I'm a senior undergraduate student at the University of Connecticut studying mathematics and statistics.

I am broadly interested in probability, statistics, and analysis. 

I have recently began a blog a will irregularly update it with some material. Other areas of site in progress.

In my free time, I enjoy spending time with friends and family, snowboarding, exercise, and puzzles.
