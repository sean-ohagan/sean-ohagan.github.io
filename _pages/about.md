I'm a senior undergraduate student at the University of Connecticut studying mathematics and statistics, with some coursework in physics as well.

I am broadly interested in probability, statistics, and analysis. 

In my free time, I enjoy snowboarding, exercising, puzzles, and spending time with friends and family.
