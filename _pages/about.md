I'm a senior undergraduate student at the University of Connecticut studying mathematics and statistics.

I am broadly interested in probability and statistics. One of my current interests is Bayesian nonparametrics.

Check out my [Visual Blog](/blog/) to see some nice expository visualizations that I'm currently working on. For example, [Polya Urn Processes](/portfolio/polya-urn).

In my free time, I enjoy spending time with friends, exercise, or snowboarding.
